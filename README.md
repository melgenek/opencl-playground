## OpenCL playground

### `hands_on`

This directory contains C/C++ solutions for the [HandsOnOpenCL course](https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Exercises-Solutions).
There are CMake executable definitions that dynamically link an OpenCL library.
The solutions were tested on MacOS with Clang and preinstalled OpenCL 1.2.
